# Translation Resources
Translations are managed through [Lokalise](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/translations/). If you'd like to contribute, you can [join the project here](https://lokalise.co/signup/3420425759f6d6d241f598.13594006/all/). For more details, see our [translation guidelines documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/translations/).

Don't make changes to these files directly. Instead, use `script/translations_download` to fetch the latest translations from Lokalise.
