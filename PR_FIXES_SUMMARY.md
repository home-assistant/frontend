## 🔄 **PR #2 NEEDS CORE REPOSITORY FIX FIRST**

### **PR #27336: Matter IP Addresses Spelling**

- **Status:** 🔄 **BLOCKED - NEEDS CORE PR**
- **Problem:** Spelling issue exists in Python backend (home-assistant/core)
- **Solution:** Must fix Core repository first, then frontend
- **Why:** Frontend uses data from backend - backend is source of truth

**What to do:**

1. Post response on PR (see PR_RESPONSES.md)
2. Fork & clone https://github.com/home-assistant/core
3. Find `ip_adresses` in `homeassistant/components/matter/`
4. Create PR on core repo with fix
5. Wait for core PR to merge
6. Then maintainer will approve your frontend PR

**This is NORMAL for full-stack bugs!** Shows you understand the architecture! 🎯
