## Using the icon

Our icon is a shorter and most used version of our logo. The icon can exist without the wordmark, the wordmark should never exist without the icon.

## Using the right variant

The pretty blue logo with a background shadow, pictured top left, is our primary logo. It should only be used with black, white, and non-duotone photography.

When needed you can use our logo without a shadow, as seen as the second variant. 

The outlined logo should only be used on packaging.

## Exclusion zone

The logo needs some personal space. It's exclusion zone is equal to a quarter the height of the icon.
