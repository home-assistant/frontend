# Our logo

As a community, we are proud of our logo. Follow these guidelines to ensure it always represents the identity of the Home Assistant project and community the best way possible.

# Design

At the core of the Home Assistant logomark is the Blue House with Antenna, the three most recognizable and distinct features of the previous logo throughout the past decade.

### Blue

Blue feels stable and essential. A bright sky blue is joyful, clear, and free of clouds.

### House

Of all possible combinations of shapes, a home is best abstracted in the shape of a structure with a pitched roof. With the vast amount of logos based on this shape, the best we can do is to make it more iconic. The house is further simplified - there is no gable and there is no chimney - to an orthogonal shape with an elegant and deliberate proportion.

### Antenna

Call it a tree, a set of nodes, a PCB, or an antenna. The antenna is the most recognizable and memorable part of the previous Home Assistant logo, and is an easily understandable symbol that conveys technologies that are smart, connected, and growing evergreen.

# Usage

The default variation is the static colored wordmark in horizontal layout and dark text on a light background.

## Layout variations

![Logo layout variants](/images/brand/logo-layout-variants.png)

The default layout is the wordmark in horizontal layout. It provides the clearest context to the brand identity of Home Assistant.

Use the logomark variant when the context is clear that the logo is about Home Assistant. For example, inside the Home Assistant app where users are already aware of where they are at, the logomark variant without the wordmark can be used. The logomark can exist without the wordmark, however, the wordmark should never exist without the icon.

Use the wordmark in vertical layout when the space available has an aspect ratio less than 4:3. For example, in a square space on a t-shirt where a logo is needed, since there is no established context of Home Assistant, the wordmark in vertical layout should be used.

Lastly, use the wordmark in vertical layout with small logomark when Home Assistant is displayed in context of other Home Assistant-related projects. For example, in a flowchart showing the voice pipeline, use this layout for Home Assistant and its other related projects.

## Color variations, backgrounds, and placement

The default color is the colored version on light background with dark text.

For backgrounds that are dark, for example, when it is used on a page in a dark theme, use the colored version on dark background with light text.

In printed materials where color is unavailable, use the monochrome color variations.

On background that are dark or photographic, use the light monochrome color on dark background variation.

On backgrounds that are light or photographic, use the colored version. Do not use the monochrome variations.

Do not enclose the logmark in a square or color or any confined backgrounds, except in specific situations enforced by another company's marketplace guidelines, for example, an iOS app icon.

Do not add drop shadow to the logomark or the wordmark. If legibility is compromised due to the background, change the background to provide more contrast, or in last resort, add a heavily blurred drop shadaow.

It should only be used with black, white, and non-duotone photography.

Unlike the previous version of our logo, no outlined variants are available. Use the monochrome variants in those spaces.

### Exclusion zone

The logo needs some personal space. Its exclusion zone is equal to a quarter the height of the icon.

## Animation

The default is the static variant.

Use the animated variant only for introductory purposes, for example, in the beginning of a video or on a loading screen.

Use the animated with sound variant only when sound is warranted in the user's context. For example, use it in the beginning of a video since sounds are expected in a video, but do not use it on a loading screen since sounds are not expected in a user interface.

Do not repeat the logo animation.

## Sizes and app icon variants

Special variants are created for specific contexts.

Use the tiny variants when the logomark is used in a very small space (16x16 dp), for example, the favicon of the Home Assistant website, a notification on Android, or the menubar of macOS.
