## Entity name selector

The entity name selector allows users to choose from entity names, device names, area names, and floor names associated with a specific entity. It provides a dropdown with contextual options based on the entity's registration and location hierarchy.

## Usage

The selector requires an entity ID to determine available name options. It will show:

- Entity friendly name (if set)
- Device name (if the entity belongs to a device)
- Area name (if the entity or device is assigned to an area)
- Floor name (if the area is assigned to a floor)

The selector allows custom values and provides descriptions for each option type to help users understand the context of each name choice.
