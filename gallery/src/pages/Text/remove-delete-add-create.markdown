# Remove vs Delete

Remove and Delete are quite similar, but can be frustrating if used inconsistently.

## Remove

Take away and set aside, but kept in existence.

For example:

- Removing a user's permission
- Removing a user from a group
- Removing links between items
- Removing a widget
- Removing a link
- Removing an item from a cart

## Delete

Erase, rendered nonexistent or nonrecoverable.

For example:

- Deleting a field
- Deleting a value in a field
- Deleting a task
- Deleting a group
- Deleting a permission
- Deleting a calendar event

# Add vs Create

In most cases, Create can be paired with Delete, and Add can be paired with Remove.

## Add

An already-exisiting item.

For example:

- Adding a permission to a user
- Adding a user to a group
- Adding links between items
- Adding a widget
- Adding a link
- Adding an item to a cart

## Create

Something made from scratch.

For example:

- Creating a new field
- Creating a new value in a field
- Creating a new task
- Creating a new group
- Creating a new permission
- Creating a new calendar event
