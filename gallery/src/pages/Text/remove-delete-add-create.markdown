# Remove vs Delete
Remove and Delete are quite similar, but can be frustrating if used inconsistently.

## Remove
Take away and set aside, but kept in existence.

For example:
* Removing a user's permission
* Removing a user from a group
* Removing links between items
* Removing a widget
* Removing a link
* Removing an item from a cart

## Delete
Erase, rendered nonexistent or nonrecoverable.

For example:
* Deleting a field
* Deleting a value in a field
* Deleting a task
* Deleting a group
* Deleting a permission
* Deleting a calendar event

# Add vs Create
In most cases, Create can be paired with Delete, and Add can be paired with Remove.

## Add
An already-exisiting item.

For example:
* Adding a permission to a user
* Adding a user to a group
* Adding links between items
* Adding a widget
* Adding a link
* Adding an item to a cart

## Create
Something made from scratch.

For example:
* Creating a new field
* Creating a new value in a field
* Creating a new task
* Creating a new group
* Creating a new permission
* Creating a new calendar event
