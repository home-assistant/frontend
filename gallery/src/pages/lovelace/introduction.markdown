Dashboards have many different cards. Each card allows the user to tell
a different story about what is going on in their house. These cards
are very customizable, as no household is the same.

This gallery helps our developers and designers to see all the
different states that each card can be in.

Check [the Dashboards documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/) for instructions on how to get started with Dashboards.
