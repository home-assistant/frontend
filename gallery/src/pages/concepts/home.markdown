# Welcome to Home Assistant Design

This portal aims to aid designers and developers on improving the Home Assistant interface. It consists of working code, resources and guidelines.

## Home Assistant interface

The Home Assistant frontend allows users to browse and control the state of their home, manage their automations and configure integrations. The frontend is designed as a mobile-first experience. It is a progressive web application and offers an app-like experience to our users. The Home Assistant frontend needs to be fast. But it also needs to work on a wide range of old devices.

### Material Design

The Home Assistant interface is based on Material Design. It's a design system created by Google to quickly build high-quality digital experiences. Components and guidelines that are custom made for Home Assistant are documented on this portal. For all other components check <a href="https://material.io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">material.io</a>.
