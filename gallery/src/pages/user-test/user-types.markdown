title: "User types"
---

We have defined three user types for Home Assistant. They are a lean segmentation of users that helps us make decisions throughout the product. User types differ from traditional personas in that the segmentation criteria aren’t demographic and don’t personify a group into a single character with a fictitious background story. 

# Outgrowers

Users that outgrow big tech smart home solutions. It just needs to work with easy setup via an app.

# Tinkerers

Technoid users in home networking and development that know how to code.

# Questioner

Users who want more advanced home automation, but need support to make it work.
