# 🚀 Running Home Assistant Frontend Locally

## ✅ Setup Complete!

I've installed all dependencies and started the development server.

## 🌐 How to View the Site

The development server is starting up. Once ready, you can view it at:

### **Gallery/Demo Mode (Component Showcase):**

- **URL:** http://localhost:8080
- **What it shows:** All Home Assistant UI components, cards, and features
- **Best for:** Seeing your changes in action

### Alternative URLs (if 8080 doesn't work):

- http://localhost:8100
- http://localhost:8000

## 📊 What You'll See

The gallery showcases:

- ✅ **Todo List Cards** - Where your ARIA fix is!
- ✅ **All Lovelace Cards** - Dashboard components
- ✅ **UI Components** - Buttons, dialogs, forms
- ✅ **Entity Cards** - Device controls
- ✅ **More Info Dialogs** - Detailed views

## 🔍 To See Your Specific Changes:

### 1. **ARIA Separator Fix (PR #1)**

- Navigate to: **Lovelace > Todo List Card**
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Inspect the todo list headers
- Look for `role="separator"` (your fix!)

### 2. **Matter IP Addresses Fix (PR #6)**

- Navigate to: **Config > Devices > Matter Device Info**
- Look for "IP address(es)" text (correctly spelled now!)

### 3. **Type Safety Improvement (PR #5)**

- This is internal TypeScript - no visual changes
- But enables better code completion!

## 🎯 What's Running

```
Server: Gallery Development Mode

## 📝 Development Tips

1. **Make a change** to any file in `src/`
2. **Save the file**
3. **Browser auto-refreshes** with your change!
4. **No need to restart** - hot module replacement is enabled
