## ðŸŽƒ Your Contribution: Fix ARIA Role Typo in Todo-List Card

### What Was Fixed

Fixed accessibility bug where ARIA role attribute was misspelled as `role="seperator"` instead of the correct `role="separator"` in the todo-list Lovelace card component.

### Why This Matters

- **Accessibility**: Incorrect ARIA roles can confuse screen readers and assistive technologies
- **Standards Compliance**: The correct ARIA role for separators is "separator", not "seperator"
- **User Experience**: Improves experience for users relying on accessibility features
- **Code Quality**: Fixes a typo that affects 4 instances in the codebase

### Files Changed

- `src/panels/lovelace/cards/hui-todo-list-card.ts` (4 fixes)

### Specific Changes

1. **Line 322**: Reorder items header - Fixed `role="seperator"` â†’ `role="separator"`
2. **Line 334**: Unchecked items header - Fixed `role="seperator"` â†’ `role="separator"`
3. **Line 349**: No status items divider - Fixed `role="seperator"` â†’ `role="separator"`
4. **Line 351**: No status items header - Fixed `role="seperator"` â†’ `role="separator"`

### Testing

The changes are straightforward typo corrections and don't affect functionality, only accessibility attributes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative Contribution Ideas

If you want to make additional contributions, here are more opportunities I found:

### 1. Console.log Cleanup

Several files have console.log statements that should be removed (but some are intentional debug logs):

- Check if they're needed for debugging or should be removed

### 2. TypeScript @ts-ignore Comments

Many test files use `@ts-ignore` comments that could be replaced with proper typing

### 3. Documentation Improvements

- The gallery/ folder contains component documentation that could be expanded
- Translation keys could be reviewed for consistency

### 4. Accessibility Enhancements

- Review other components for missing ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Check color contrast ratios
